 There are only about 740 mountain gorillas remaining in their natural habitat. These gentle giants are found in the Virunga Mountains (a chain of volcanoes with altitudinal ranges of 3500m-4507m). The oldest Park in Africa.

Presently,Rwanda not only enjoys the best security in the region but also has the easiest access routes for visiting the mountain gorillas.

Volcanoes National Park (Parc Nacional Des Volcans) - Rwanda are currently has 8 habituated gorilla families that can be visited.<br>

<div style='border:1px solid green;color:white;margin-left:-50px' align="justify" class="col-md-4">
In order to minimize behavioral disturbances to the gorillas, only 8 people are allowed to visit each of the families and for a period not exceeding 1hour. The limits serve to protect gorillas from the risk of exposure to human-borne diseases. Please note that only children of 15 years of age are allowed into the park for Gorillas trek and only until 12 years of age are allowed into the park for Golden monkeys. Under 12 years of age are allowed into the park for other activities such Nature walks, Diana Fossey Tomb, …. accompanied by one of their parent or by an adult.

						<p class="dummy-text aitsheadingw3">Akagera National Park</p>
						<p class="dummy-text"> Akagera National Park is located in the north east of Rwanda along the border with Tanzania. Although founded in 1934, much of the park was re-allocated as farms and in 1997 the park was reduced in size from more than 2,500 sq km (nearly 10% of the surface area of Rwanda) to its current extent of 1,122 sq km. Since 2010, a joint venture with African Parks has seen Akagera return to its former glories.

								It is named after the Akagera River that flows along its eastern boundary and feeds into a labyrinth of lakes of which the largest is Lake Ihema. The forest fringed lakes, papyrus swamps, savannah plains and rolling highlands combine to make Akagera amongst the most scenic of reserves anywhere in Africa. It has exceptional levels of biodiversity and forms the largest protected wetland in central Africa.
								
								Akagera combines well with Nyungwe and the Volcanoes NP to offer a great safari element as it is home to many large plains game species as well as species restricted to the papyrus swamps such as the Sitatunga and the sought-after Shoebill Stork. Notable plains game include elephant, buffalo, topi, zebra, waterbuck, roan antelope and eland. Other antelope are duiker, oribi, bohor reedbuck, klipspringer, bushbuck and impala. Of the primates, olive baboons, vervets and the secretive blue monkey are seen during the day, with bushbabies often seen on night drives.</p>

						<div class="dummy-img dummy-img-3"><img src="images/volc.jpg" alt="wanderlust"></div>

						<p class="dummy-text aitsheadingw3">Volcanoes National Park</p>
						<p class="dummy-text">The Volcanoes National Parklies along the Virunga Mountains, with 8 ancient volcanoes, which are shared by Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Just a short two hour drive from Rwanda’s capital of Kigali, the park is a central location for exploring some distinctly Rwandan experiences. While a visit to the mountain gorillas is often at the top of visitor, the dramatic landscape also offers thrilling hiking and visits to the fascinating golden monkeys.

								PNV is also one of Rwanda’s conservation epicenters, where many non-profit organizations base their operations. Visitors can pay homage to the legendary scientist and gorilla advocate Dian Fossey with a hike to her tomb or a visit to the Dian Fosse Gorilla Fund that continues her legacy of research and advocacy to this day.
								
								Near the park, the bustling and vibrant markets of Musanze are a place to immerse yourself into everyday Rwandan culture. Go deep into the earth with Musanze’s caves – one of the area’s newest attractions. </p>

						<div class="dummy-img dummy-img-4"><img src="images/nyungwe.jpg" style="height:275px"  alt="wanderlust"></div>
						<p class="dummy-text aitsheadingw3">Nyungwe National Park Destination</p>
						<p class="dummy-text">This national park is also the largest tropical afro Montane rainforest east or central Africa and a rainforest it is and receives over 2000mm of rain each year and its Rwanda’s largest water catchment area and its home to 2/3rds of all Rwanda’s water.  The forest also feeds both the river Congo and the River Nile with water.

								When you arrive in Nyungwe forest, you come here on the winding roads through the huge tea fields and then there is Nyungwe forest national park, like developing its massiveness like a national Geographic Video and only better since you are here in that large forest with its endless Kamiranzovu swamp, the trails through out, the forest canopy walk, which is the only one in East Africa, the chances for birding, the primate tracking and viewing and taking in the flowers like the orchids that are found here and the many butterflies that they attract.
								
								Nyungwe is also not a compact park but large forest and the things to do and see here also take some planning as that your time on the safari is not wasted with drive times. You can also find over 300 different bird species, many butterflies, orchids, 75 mammal species including the 13 primates, and there have also been the sightings of the golden monkeys. Also the park is with its uncountable of the natural wonders and is not missed if you are coming to Rwanda and it will be one of those items to mountain gorilla tracking in Rwanda. </p>

						<div class="dummy-img dummy-img-5"><img src="images/kivu.jpg" style="height:275px"  alt="wanderlust"></div>
						<p class="dummy-text aitsheadingw3">Rubavu</p>
						<p class="dummy-text">The famous Congo-Nile trail which is a magnificent nature trail that runs from Rubavu along Lake Kivu traversing the districts of Karongi, Rutsiro, Rusizi and Nyamasheke. The trail which can be explored on bike, foot and by car is 224km in distance and can last ten (10) full days if explored by foot.

							The Pfunda Tea Estate is Rubavu’s other hot spot presenting a magical encounter for the tea enthusiasts as they explore the process of tea growing, processing along with packaging and its shipping to the region of East Africa and the other parts of the world.
							
							The Gishwati-Mukura National Park which is the recent addition to the Rwanda’s National Park list provides shelter to counts of chimpanzees, l’hoest monkeys, the black and white colobus monkeys, blue monkeys along with golden monkeys. This will enable travellers to view Chimpanzees and Colobus monkeys at a close location after gorilla trekking in Rwanda’s Volcanoes National Park substituting the long drive to Nyungwe in the south west.
							
							Mount Rubavu which offers remarkable mountain hikes gaining magical views of Gisenyi town while Mount Muhungwe with the highest non volcanic peak in Rubavu offers a 7 hour hiking adventure. The more sophisticated Mountain Karisimbi takes 2 days and is ideal for active climbers.
							
							Lake Kivu which provides the remarkable kayaking and Bilharzia free water swimming experience along with impressive resort and beach encounter on its fascinating shores also makes Rubavu unique.</p>

						<div class="dummy-img dummy-img-6"><img src="images/karongi.jpg" style="height:275px"  alt="wanderlust"></div>
						<p class="dummy-text aitsheadingw3">Karongi Island</p>
						<p class="dummy-text">Karongi is one of the most relaxing and romantic places in Rwanda, and is an ideal place to enjoy lakeside recreation. A picturesque lakeside resort town, there are ample beaches with crystal clear water. Along with modern water sport facilities, traditional boats can be used for exciting nature discovery tours and authentic experiences within local Rwandan daily life. Visitors can take boat rides from many of the local hotels visiting Napoleon’s Island (home to a colony of fruit bats) and dine at the Amahoro Island restaurants and even go night fishing with locals

							Adventure awaits at Karongi with opportunities to hike and bike the Congo Nile Trail, visit the Congo Nile Divide watershed, have a taste of the ‘crop to cup’ coffee and tea experiences within the local community, or visit the moving Bisesero Genocide Memorial with breathtaking views of the lake.</p>

						<p class="dummy-text aitsheadingw3">Kigali Convection Centre</p>
						<p class="dummy-text">A STYLISH CONFERENCE HOTEL IN KIGALI NEAR THE AIRPORT AND CITY CENTER

						<div class="dummy-img dummy-img-8"><img src="images/king.jpg" style="height:275px"  alt="wanderlust"></div>
						<p class="dummy-text aitsheadingw3">Heritage Corridor</p>
						<p class="dummy-text">Situated on a hill 2km southwest of town, this fascinating museum is less about ancient history and more about royal residences. The displays centre on a replica king's ‘palace’. Inclusive in the ticket price is a guided tour that helps explain some of the architectural idiosyncrasies inside the royal compound, including why the royal beer brewer’s hut had an entrance without a lip, and other curiosities such as why the woman who looked after the king’s milk was never able to marry.

						Behind the royal compound are the inyambo (sacred cows) with their super-sized horns. In some, the span between horn tip and horn tip exceeds 2.5m. Despite their fearsome appearance they seem to like nothing better than having lullabies sung to them!
						
						Crowning the hill itself is the royal residence of King Mutara III Rudahigwa, built by Belgium in 1931. This colonial-style home served as the royal palace until he died. Unfortunately most of the furniture and gifts he received from visiting dignitaries were stolen during the genocide, but it’s still an interesting home to wander through, with its peculiarities including three sitting rooms, the best of which was reserved for receiving white people. There are also excellent panels (in English) about Rwanda's history. Mutara was the first mwami (king) to convert to Catholicism and in the beginning was so enthralled by the Belgian rulers that he once thanked God for having sent them to Rwanda.</p>

							<div class="dummy-img dummy-img-8"><img src="D:\Year 2\She can Code\Java\anna\images\muhazi.jpg" style="height:275px"  alt="wanderlust"></div>
							<p class="dummy-text aitsheadingw3">Lake Muhazi</p>
							<p class="dummy-text">Even though it’s only slightly more than 40 kilometres east of Kigali, the winding shores of Lake Muhazi see few visitors (and of these, most tend to be locals and expats escaping the city for a weekend), but the region has a laid-back, subtle charm all its own, and with such easy access from Kigali, there’s really no reason not to explore the winding shores and placid waters of Lake Muhazi.

								Long and shallow, Lake Muhazi twists and turns its way through a flooded valley for more than 40km before reaching its eastern shore, not far from the northern exit of eastern Rwanda’s crown jewel, Akagera National Park. The east end of the lake sits right along the road to Nyagatare, and makes for a perfect place to break the journey for a meal and a cold drink after long hours spent bumping along the park’s dirt roads. If you stick around after your fresh-caught lunch and let the lake breezes guide you, you’ll quickly find that the live music at the lakeside bars, dozens of traditional villages along the shore, and the fantastic birding and fishing on offer will keep you here well longer than expected.</p>
